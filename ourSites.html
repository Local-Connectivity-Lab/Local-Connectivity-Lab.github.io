      <h2>Overview:</h2>
      <p>
        Through our volunteer efforts and community partnerships, we 
        strive to provide low-income and in-need users with free or 
        low-cost Internet service as reliably as possible. Our service 
        is best-effort and will not necessarily match the performance of 
        paid or commercial Internet service.
        <br><br>
        Our network includes site locations throughout King County and 
        Tacoma, where we are able to provide coverage within specific 
        neighborhoods near the sites. Please refer to the list of 
        locations below to see if your neighborhood is covered. 
        <br><br>
        Within these coverage areas, we can offer either home-based WiFi 
        or mobile (phone-based) Internet access options. 
      </p>

      <h2>Details:</h2>
      <p>
        -You will need to register with us and receive our SIM card to 
        connect to the network.
        <br>
        -You may also need to receive a compatible mobile phone or 
        stationary home hotspot from us that supports our wireless frequencies.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        We expect that speeds would typically range from 30-90 Mbps 
        download/2-14 Mbps upload. Part of the purpose of this pilot 
        project is to determine the technology’s real performance and 
        suitability for our use case.
        <br><br>

        The speed of your service will depend roughly on: 
        <br>
        -how many other users are currently using the network
        <br>
        -how close your location is to the access point
        <br>
        -whether you are using the mobile phone-based or home-based service (home-based is usually faster)
      </p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        For the first round of our installations, which have been funded this 
        past year by King County and the City of Seattle IT, we will prioritize 
        serving the following groups:
        <br>
        -low-income families of students
        <br>
        -unemployed adults (looking for work)
        <br>
        -majority non-English speaking adults/families
        <br>
        -Seniors
        <br><br>
        If you are eligible and interested in participating, please 
        email lcl@seattlecommunitynetwork.org or leave a voice message 
        or text at (253) 655-7221‬. You may also drop in at our
