      <h2> Local Connectivity Lab </h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Seattle Community Network began in 2019 as a project of the 
          Local Connectivity Lab (LCL), a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit 
          that develops and deploys open source cellular network technologies 
          to help people run their own community networks. LCL works in 
          partnership with the University of Washington (UW) to share free 
          or low-cost broadband access in higher-need areas throughout the 
          city, making use of existing city network infrastructure such as 
          buildings and fiber-optic cables to extend coverage to more people. 
          Our mission is to facilitate community focused technology 
          development and research in support of low-income, marginalized 
          populations and groups.
